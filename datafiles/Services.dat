Tile Sealing

     Tile and grout sealing can go a long way towards saving you future problems.  Depending on what kind of floor tile you have, you may or may not need to seal it.  However, grout should always be coated with a masonry sealer to prevent staining and crumbling.<br />     Some tile and stone is very porous and easily stained as it will soak up liquid readily. A grape juice spill on your beautiful travertine kitchen floor can prove disastrous.  Once the liquid penetrates and stains, there is no choice but to replace the tile.  It cannot be cleaned.<br />     Ford's Cleaning can clean and seal your tile, grout and stonework for you.  We use various types of sealers that are best suited to your needs.<br />     Don't chance damaging your beautiful and expensive tile or stone.

Custom Yard Care

Ford's Custom Yard Care is Back.<br /><br />Back by demand, Ford's will doing custom yard care this season in full swing.   Upon inception, Ford's Cleaning offered custom yard care along with our cleaning services offering our customers a complete home care package.   Due to the heavy demand at the time we chose to slow our growth a little as to not compromise our service quality.  Subsequently we opted to do away with the yard care.   However in those past 8 years we have never gotten completely away from it.  Each year I have our truly dedicated clients pleading with me to continue with their yard care.<br />Ultimately, we have decided to put the Custom Yard Care portion of our services back in business.   I am very comfortable about this decision especially with the high quality work force that has now become more readily available.<br />Ford's Custom Yard Care is for the discriminating homeowner.  Have you dreamed of the yard and landscape that is impeccably cared for?  Would you like your yard to stand out and draw attention?  The details make the difference and that's where we come in!<br />Please use our automated quote requester for a personal inspection and care quote for your yard!
