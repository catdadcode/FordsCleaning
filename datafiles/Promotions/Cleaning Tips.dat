Cleaning Tips
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cleaning Floor Tile and Grout</span><br><br>First removing dry soil with a vacuum or dust mop will make your mopping <br>much easier and more effective.&nbsp; Mopping your tile with just plain water<br>works great.&nbsp; There are many kinds of tile cleaners that you can purchase and add to your water, but it is not always necessary.&nbsp; As hard as it is on the knees, hand mopping works best by far. (a good pair of knee pads is a worth while investment)&nbsp; You are able to get corners and edges closer than you can with any stick mop.&nbsp; There are many good mops on the market, but for my money a nice clean terry towel works wonders!<br>Moving on to the grout.&nbsp; If your grout is clean after mopping then you are done.&nbsp; However, if your grout is discolored you may want to spruce it up a bit.&nbsp; you can effectively clean grout by mixing 1 part chlorine bleach to 5 parts water.&nbsp; Using a grout brush, use your solution to wet the grout and scrub with the brush, then mop dry.&nbsp; (never mix bleach with any ammonia based cleaner)&nbsp; Also, if you have colored grout, do not use the bleach/water solution as this may remove some of the color.<br>After drying thoroughly, a good masonry sealer applied on the grout will eliminate most of that scrubbing in the future.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cleaning Tub and Shower Soap Scum</span><br><br>First of all I have a couple of tips in helping to prevent the buildup of soap scum to begin with.&nbsp; Now if you sell bar soap don't get upset, but getting rid of the bar of soap in your soap dish will eliminate so much mess and hassle you won't believe it.&nbsp; Simply replace that bar with your favorite brand in a liquid soap.&nbsp; This step alone can save much aggravation.&nbsp; The next tip is to purchase a bathroom squeegee.&nbsp; One of those kinds that just suction cups to the shower wall.&nbsp;  After every shower, simply use the squeegee to pull all the water down to the bottom.&nbsp; Squeegee the remaining water down the drain.&nbsp;  You might feel the next step is a little excessive, but after using the squeegee, I dry all the corners and edges with a towel!&nbsp; Then you have a nice clean shower/tub that does not even have a chance to get a buildup of soap scum or hard water.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  If its a little late for the preventative measures and you need to get it nice and clean first, you need a high alkaline soap scum remover.&nbsp;  There are many available at your local supermarket.&nbsp; However, if you wish to get it clean once and prevent it from happening again, you may not want to purchase a whole bottle of cleaner that can cost you upwards of $5.00.&nbsp;  Here's the secret.&nbsp;  Take some of your dish washing detergent and mix it with some water in a bucket.&nbsp;  That's it.&nbsp; You have just mixed up a high alkaline cleaner that will remove the soap scum.&nbsp; Of course if your buildup is high you are going to need elbow grease and plenty of it.&nbsp; But once the job is complete, you will have amazed yourself!<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeping The Dirt Outside of Your House</span><br><br>About Eighty percent of the dirt in your house comes in through the door on people's feet/shoes.&nbsp; A "No Shoe Policy" in your house is a great step in reducing the amount of dust and dirt in your home.&nbsp; It will also add to the life of your carpet/tile/wood flooring. But what about before the shoes come off? The right kind of mats placed inside and out of all entrances will save you much cleaning time. Choose professional type mats that you see at the entrance to commercial businesses, which are available at&nbsp; janitorial supply and home stores. These are called walk-off mats because they give the dirt a chance to be walked off before it gets in. Walk-off mats are usually nylon or olefin with a rubber back for inside the door, and rubber or vinyl-backed synthetic turf for outside the door.&nbsp; Vacuum mats regularly or shake them out. You can also take them outside and hose them off.&nbsp;  If necessary you can scrub them with an all purpose cleaner.&nbsp;  Make sure to hang mats to dry thoroughly.&nbsp; Never put a wet mat back down on the floor as the moisture can damage the surface.<br>The addition of mats to your home is a small investment that can save you a lot of time and money in the future.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Window Cleaning</span><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A task that nobody likes yet at some point needs to be tackled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Actually it can be a little easier than you think and with the right
tools you will be able to see through those windows in no time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
only tool you may need to purchase is a squeegee if you don't already
have one.&nbsp; You can also use a window scrubber if you want but if you
don't have one a towel will do.&nbsp; Mix 3 or four drops of liquid dish
soap into about a half gallon of water in a bucket.&nbsp; You can also add a
cap full of ammonia if you have it handy, if not just skip that step.&nbsp;
Now using your window scrubber or towel, saturate it in the solution
and scrub the window.&nbsp; After you completely scrub the window, use a
clean terry towel and ipe the top and left edge of the window. (the
width of your finger).&nbsp; Now using your squeegee horizontally, run the
squeegee left to right slightly angling the blade down.&nbsp; The water will
constantly be running&nbsp; down and away from you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wipe your blade after
every stroke.&nbsp; When you finish up wipe the bottom ledge of the glass to
clean up the last bit of water.&nbsp; Resist the urge to wipe down the glass
with your towel now, it will likely smear your work that you just
completed.&nbsp; You should now have nice clean windows!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more
trick for exterior windows that are stained with hard water.&nbsp; If you
maintain the windows well and don't let the hard water get to bad, you
can simply scrub the window glass with a blue backed scrub sponge and
some toilet bowl cleaner that contains phosphoric acid.&nbsp; After
scrubbing the window, rinse it will with clean water and then proceed
to your squeegee routine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For worse windows it would be wise to consult a professional, so you don't run the risk of scratching your glass.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Removing Pet Stains from Carpet</span><br><br>We deal with pet stain and odor removal almost daily,
however before the problem calls for professional cleaning, you can
perform light cleanup yourself.<br>If you have a pet that has
occasional accidents or you are planning on potty training a new pet,
then the first thing you want to have on hand is a bacteria/enzyme
digester.&nbsp; This is available at your local pet supply or janitorial
supply store.&nbsp; In ideal circumstances you will see the urine spot while
it is still fresh.&nbsp; If not, the same cleanup methods apply.&nbsp; Just keep
in mind the older the stain, the more difficult it will be to clean.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>If
you catch the stain while it is still wet, use a dry cotton/terry towel
to blot the wetness out.&nbsp; You can even lay the towel on the stain and
step on it.&nbsp; Repeat this procedure until you can no longer remove any
wetness.&nbsp; Never, never scrub on your carpet!&nbsp; You will fray the fibers
and make a permanent mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; After removing the moisture, apply the
bacteria/enzyme digester.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply it liberally, especially if the urine
has soaked down through the carpet and pad.&nbsp; You need to apply the
enzyme solution to soak as far down as the urine.&nbsp; After applying the
enzyme, lay a piece of plastic over the spot to keep it from drying to
quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The enzyme digester continues to work as long as it is
moist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, hopefully by the time the spot dries you have no more
urine!<br>Beyond that, for worse problems you will have no choice other
than professional cleaning and possibly replacement of the carpet.&nbsp; If
the spot is a popular place for your pet, the urine could be all the
way into the floor boards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Urine removal&nbsp; and treatment is a step by
step process because you never know how far down you are dealing with
it.<br>But typically they can be dealt with before you have to reach the replacement stage!&nbsp; <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Removing Coffee Stains</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"><span style=""> </span>What to do when that cup of
coffee spills is very simple.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However
the sooner you act the better.<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Immediately blot or extract as much
of the liquid as possible with a dry, clean towel.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then using a spray bottle with plain cold
water (always use cold water, hot water will only serve to set the stain)
dampen the area and with a clean towel attempt to remove as much of the coffee
as possible. (remember to blot! rubbing the carpet can fray the fibers and
cause a noticeable mark in the carpet).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the stain remains, mix the spray bottle with 50/50 water and plain
white vinegar and blot carefully in the carpet fibers. Let it sit for
approximately 15 minutes. Coffee is an acid which settles in the actual carpet
fibers, and the vinegar is a stronger acid which will displace the coffee
stain. Blot carefully to remove moisture. If you have succeeded, use a clean
towel again with plain water to blot out the vinegar.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">If a stain remains after the carpet
has dried, get a bottle of hydrogen peroxide. Pour it directly on the stain and
work it in and around the stained fibers. Let it dry, and repeat if needed. You
do not need to remove the hydrogen peroxide as it will turn to water when
exposed to sunlight. You may need to apply the hydrogen peroxide a few times to
completely remove the stain. <br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"></span></p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Dealing with Clutter<br><br></span></span>Excessive clutter in your home is not just difficult to work around!&nbsp;
Cluttered surroundings can have profound effects on you, your family,
and your entire life.&nbsp;&nbsp; A cluttered, messy and busy environment has
been proven to have a dramatic negative impact on your physical and
mental well being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just living with over clutter and disorganization
can lead to unwanted&nbsp; and unnecessary stress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I find when
working with people in their homes and offices is that many of us kind
of let this situation creep up on us and then, being frustrated, don't
really know where to start to get the situation back into control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clear the room to clear your mind!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you lack a focal point to get a
grip on the clutter, just clear it all out first.&nbsp; Move everything into
the garage, a spare room, anywhere that relieves the targeted area of
the mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you will be able to look at the room with a fresh
perspective.&nbsp; Then slowly start to sort through the all the items that
you removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find that much of it can go right into the
waste can!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I prefer the "clean as you go" method to
avoid the clutter in the first place.&nbsp; But if it creeps up on you as it
sometimes will, don't let it get the best of you.&nbsp; Take a step back and
a deep breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approach it calmly and dig in.&nbsp; There are many methods
of staying organized after you get there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a little research and
find out what works best for you.&nbsp; You can tackle the issue on your own
or if its just not your thing, you can of course hire a professional to
help you out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
