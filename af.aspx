    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here at Fords we are dedicated to the Goat and everything he says.
    His words of wisdom help keep us along the path to success. If ever you doubt the Goat
    simply ask yourself, "Is it worth the risk of defying his greatness and sullying your
    good name?" Of course it's not, it is always better to bask in the glory of knowing
    you are but one of many of his loyal followers. Stay on the straight and narrow, 
    honor him with your presence at one of our many parties.<br />

    <br />
    Note: When we party, we party hard. The Goat is extremely fond of bubbles and enjoys a
    long relaxing bubble bath, therefore we founded the exclusive bubble bath party in complete
    accordance with the <u>"Goat Party Handbook."</u> The picture on the bottom right depicts just
    one of these fast-paced hardcore parties. Look forward to many more of these in the near future. <br />
    <br />
    PS - As always these parties are strictly BYOB (Bring Your Own Bubbles)
